> Syntax definitions for highlighter extensions and other tools that display the Architect file format


## Build the syntax definitions

```bash
npm run build
```


## Notes / caveats

- The TextMate + Oniguruma grammar system does not enable conditional patterns, or expressions that can change state by matching across multiple lines
  - This poses some unique challenges for the Architect format, which is quite minimal, and uses significant whitespace
- Additionally, due to the way this system captures, liberal use of regex lookarounds is necessary to capture certain patterns in specific circumstances (e.g. inline arrays) without introducing weirdness or overlapping in capture groups
